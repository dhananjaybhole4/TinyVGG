# TinyVGG

 This repository contains a neural network model inspired by TinyVGG. It include full data preparation containing three classes ['chicken_curry','chocolate_cake','ice_cream'] , model building, training and evaluation forming a complete machine learning pipeline

 ### Image

Following image represent the structure of neural network model. The only difference is, there are there classes or there output terms in the model built in this repository
